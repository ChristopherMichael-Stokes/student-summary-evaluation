# Student Summary Evaluation

The repository holds the NLP based experiments towards assigning scores for student summarisations of various topics. - relating to this [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlit-evaluate-student-summaries/overview) 

My aim was originally to start with ML and feature engineering models before moving on to deep learning based approaches, however due to personal time constraints I only really dedicated time to the former and in the end placed more of a target on optimisation than training the best model.

This led to landing at position 25 (was also at position 3 for a long while but didn't really develop my model quality since hence the drop) in the final submission efficiency benchmark - https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/evaluate-student-summaries-efficiency-lb
